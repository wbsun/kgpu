          <pre><code> KGPU - Augmenting Linux with GPUs
</code></pre>

<p>What is it?</p>

<pre><code> Treating the GPU as a computing co-processor. To enable the
 data-parallel computation inside the Linux kernel. Using SIMD (or
 SIMT in CUDA) style code to accelerate Linux kernel
 functionality.

 Make the Linux kernel really parallelized: which is not only
 processing multiple requests concurrently, but can also partition
 a single large requested computation into tiles and do them on
 GPU cores.

 GPU can give the OS kernel dedicated cores that can be fully
 occupied by the kernel. But the multicore CPUs should not be
 occupied by the kernel because other tasks also need them.

 KGPU is not an OS running on GPU, which is almost impossible
 because of the limited functionality of current GPU
 architectures. KGPU tries to enable vector computing for the
 kernel.

 *To access the code, using git to clone:
 git@github.com:wbsun/kgpu.git or goto
 https://github.com/wbsun/kgpu .*

 As for copyright license, we use GPLv2.
</code></pre>

<p>Try it?</p>

<pre><code>Hardware:
We use GTX480 or Tesla C2070. You don't need such high-end video
    card, but you should have a NVIDIA card that support CUDA
    computing capability 2.0 or higher.  If you don't have more
    than 1G video memory, change KGPU_BUF_SIZE in kgpu/kgpu.h to
    make sure KGPU_BUF_SIZE*2 &lt; Size of Your Video
    Memory - (x) where the max of x is a value that you need try
    some times to figure out. Or simply leave x = 64M or 128M.

Notice a new change: we enabled a new feature to allow
KGPU remapping any kernel pages into CUDA page-locked
memory, the remapping also need video memory on the GPU
side, so now there are two GPU buffers with the same size,
which is KGPU_BUF_SIZE. So KGPU_BUF_SIZE should be &lt;=
video memory size/2.

Software:
    We compile the CUDA code with nvcc in CUDA 4.2. The OS
kernel is vanilla Linux 2.6.39.4 to 3.4. You MUST use a 64bit linux
kernel compiled targeting at x86_64!

Make and Run it:
    Check out the code from Github or download the
    archive from Google Code and extract files into say kgpu
    directory:
    cd kgpu &amp;&amp; make all

Now all outputs are in build directory. To run it:
    cd build &amp;&amp; sudo ./runkgpu

This only starts KGPU module, helper and loads AES ciphers.
To use modified eCryptfs and dm-crypt, in the build directory:
    sudo insmod ./ecryptfs.ko &amp;&amp; sudo insmod ./dm-crypt


    NOTE: DO NOT USE THIS ECRYPTS FOR IMPORTANT DATA!!!
          THIS IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE VANILLA ECRYPTFS.
      SAME CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH DM-CRYPT.

To stop it:
    Umount your eCryptfs partition, delete dm-crypt mappers and:
    sudo rmmod ecryptfs &amp;&amp; sudo rmmod dm-crypt
    Stop "helper" program by Ctrl-C
    sudo ./stopkgpu (in build/)
